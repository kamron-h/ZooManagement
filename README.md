# ZooManagement
 The Zoo Management App is a simple Android application designed to provide information about different animals in a zoo. This app is particularly focused on two animals: the lion and the elephant. Users can learn about these animals by clicking on dedicated buttons that reveal interesting facts and details about each animal.
